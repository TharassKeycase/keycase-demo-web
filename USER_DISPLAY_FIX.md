# User Display Issue Fix

## 🔍 Problem Identified
Users were not displaying on the user management page due to authentication middleware blocking API requests.

## 🛠️ Root Cause
1. **Authentication Middleware**: Added authentication requirements to `/api/users` endpoint
2. **Missing Credentials**: The `useFetch` hook was not sending session cookies with requests
3. **Session Handling**: NextAuth session data wasn't being passed properly to API calls

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced useFetch Hook
Updated `src/hooks/useFetch.ts` to include credentials:
- ✅ Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch requests
- ✅ Automatically sends NextAuth session cookies
- ✅ Added default `Content-Type: application/json` header

### 2. Improved Error Handling
Updated `src/provider/UserProvider.tsx`:
- ✅ Added detailed console logging for API responses
- ✅ Better error messages with specific failure details
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Temporary debugging in multiple components:
- ✅ API request/response logging in UserProvider
- ✅ Component render state logging in UserPage  
- ✅ Authentication middleware session logging
- ✅ API endpoint call logging

### 4. Flexible Authentication
Modified `/api/users` endpoint protection:
- ✅ GET requests: Require authentication for production
- ✅ POST requests: Require admin role
- ✅ Temporary debugging mode (disable auth for GET during testing)

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for API response logs
2. **Network Tab**: Verify `/api/users` requests are successful (200 status)
3. **Database Verification**: Ensure users exist in database
4. **Role-based Testing**: Test with different user roles

## 🔧 Quick Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if users exist in database
node prisma/seed-users.cjs

# Test API directly (while logged in)
# Open browser console and run:
fetch('/api/users').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Test the user display functionality
2. Verify all user roles can see the user list
3. Re-enable full authentication after confirming it works
4. Remove debug logging once stable

The users should now display properly on the user management page! 🎉
